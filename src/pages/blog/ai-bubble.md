Throughout modern economic history, transformative technologies and speculative manias have been frequent, if uneasy, partners. The railway boom of the 1840s laid the tracks for a new industrial age, but not before bankrupting countless investors. The dot-com surge of the late 1990s built the foundational infrastructure of the digital economy, but only after a spectacular market crash vaporized trillions in paper wealth. The current moment in artificial intelligence bears an uncanny resemblance to these historical precedents. It is a period defined by a breakthrough innovation, a seemingly infinite horizon of possibility, and an atmosphere of expectation so thick that it borders on financial euphoria, but what is it actually bringing to the table?

By looking at how the AI economy behaves, we can see that it is defined by waves of investment capital, inflated valuations, and a psychological fear of missing out. Venture capital, corporate R&D, and public markets have funneled hundreds of billions of dollars into the sector, racing to build massive models and the vast data centers they require. Simultaneously, the social discourse has amplified both optimism and anxiety, with utopian predictions of post-scarcity productivity running alongside dystopian fears of a jobless future. This potent combination of revolutionary promise and uncertain monetization paths creates the perfect conditions for a speculative bubble.

The primary engine of this potential bubble is the sheer scale of capital investment. The saying goes, ‘In a gold rush, sell shovels’, and the main shovel designer, NVIDIA, as of now, is worth 5 trillion dollars. That is more than the GDP of every single country on earth, except China and the United States, in which NVIDIA is listed. Particularly in the United States, corporate spending on AI infrastructure has reached levels that dwarf previous tech booms. Analysts project that U.S. AI capital expenditures could surge past US$500 billion annually by 2026–27 (Oxford Economics 2025). This spending is overwhelmingly directed at the foundational layer: cloud computing, advanced GPUs, and the colossal facilities needed for model training. While this investment is undeniably accelerating innovation, its blistering pace far outstrips any current profitability. This gap between outlay and return is a classic symptom of speculative imbalance, where capital is allocated based on future hope rather than present cash flow.

This economic haemorrhage is mirrored in public equity markets. A handful of technology giants, now deriving the bulk of their staggering valuations from expectations of AI dominance, have become proxies for the revolution itself. This has led to extreme market concentration. A 2025 Reuters survey starkly captured the mood, finding that over half of global fund managers now believe AI-linked stocks are in bubble territory. Yet, this belief does not deter investment. The prevailing behavior is driven by a fear of missing out on a paradigm shift, leading capital to flow to any asset deemed “AI-exposed,” often irrespective of its underlying fundamentals or present earnings.

Fueling this financial momentum is a powerful narrative multiplier. When an innovation transitions from a technical tool to a cultural phenomenon, its story can inflate valuations as much as its balance sheet. The widespread association of “AI” with progress and inevitability has created a halo effect, encouraging speculative confidence. Researchers have identified this as a form of “semantic inflation,” where the mere invocation of “AI” in a product description or an investor pitch can dramatically raise credibility and price. This has always been a slippery slope, and we’ve seen these same trends of semantic inflation in the dot com bubble.

This concentration of capital and narrative in a few dominant firms creates a unique systemic fragility. As both institutional investors and retail portfolios become over-exposed to this narrow, high-growth segment of the market, the entire financial ecosystem becomes tethered to its fortunes. A slowdown in innovation, a regulatory setback, or a disappointing earnings report from one or two of these leading firms could ripple across global indices, impacting sectors far removed from technology. Looking at the S&P 500, the bulk of worth is tied to the big three AI giants, NVIDIA, OpenAI, and Microsoft.

Perhaps the most significant risk underpinning the current market is the “promise gap”, the widening chasm between productivity expectations and on-the-ground reality. The core belief driving the optimism is that AI will unlock a new era of economic growth. However, empirical data on this front remains frustratingly mixed. A recent, sobering MIT study found that a staggering 95% of corporate generative-AI initiatives failed to generate any measurable financial return in their first year of operation. While many firms are experimenting with the technology, few have successfully achieved scalable, operational benefits that move the needle on revenue or efficiency. If these productivity gains remain elusive, the lofty valuations built on their assumption will eventually, and perhaps suddenly, confront the limits of belief.

This mismatch between investment and realized value is the most immediate threat. As one economist cautioned, “When capital is allocated based on hope rather than cash flow, the reversion to reality can be sudden”. Should major AI projects continue to under-deliver on their commercial promise, investors could rapidly reprice their expectations, triggering a cascade of de-risking and unwinding leveraged positions? This risk is compounded by emerging physical and environmental constraints. The resource intensity of training large-scale AI models, in terms of electricity, specialized chips, and water for cooling, is beginning to test the limits of our physical infrastructure. Analysts warn of looming bottlenecks in energy grids and the semiconductor supply chain that could significantly slow deployment or inflate costs. If the physical supply of computation cannot keep pace with market demand, firms may find it impossible to justify their expansion plans and, by extension, their valuations. The Bank of England has explicitly cautioned that “a sharp market correction” in technology valuations, driven by such constraints or a simple loss of faith, could pose systemic risks to the broader financial system.

This entire cycle, from hype to investment to disappointment, is perhaps the most conclusive piece of evidence indicating a large-scale bubble. Research on innovation cycles demonstrates that excessive hype often leads to a distorted allocation of both talent and capital. It privileges symbolic participation, or “being in AI,” over the difficult work of achieving real productivity gains. When this “hype-misallocation loop” inevitably breaks, market enthusiasm can turn abruptly to skepticism, amplifying volatility and punishing those who arrived late.

And yet, this is not the entire story. According to Goldman Sachs, to dismiss the current moment as solely a bubble is to ignore the profound technological shift underway. Despite all the speculative symptoms, AI represents a genuine, general-purpose technology. The counter-argument is not that the bubble isn’t real, but that the underlying technology is also real. They also argue that while valuations are undeniably stretched, the long-term potential is so vast that even modest productivity gains of 1-2% per year, distributed across major economies, could ultimately justify much of the current investment.

Furthermore, direct comparisons to the dot-com mania may be misleading. A long-term bubble analysis by Coatue Management found that while AI valuations are certainly elevated, they remain below the astronomical, earnings-devoid peaks of the late 1990s. This suggests we may be in a period of “early-cycle exuberance” rather than a late-stage, frantic mania.

There is also the question of what the investment leaves behind. Unlike the ephemeral value of many cryptocurrency tokens or the purely speculative pricing of subprime mortgage assets, the current AI boom is building tangible, durable capital. The cloud capacity, semiconductor fabrication plants, and data pipelines being constructed today are enduring assets. Even if the current wave of investment overshoots and many AI applications fail, this infrastructure will retain its long-term utility, serving as the foundation for the next wave of innovation.

Given this dual reality, a simple binary verdict, bubble or innovation, is insufficient. What looks like irrational exuberance might be the messy, inefficient, but ultimately necessary process of financing the birth of a new industrial platform. Personally, I believe one of the probable outcomes is not a systemic crash, but a period of correction and consolidation. In this “soft landing” scenario, over-investment leads to moderation. Valuations will stabilize, weaker and purely speculative startups will fail, and capital will rotate from hype-driven narratives toward firms demonstrating genuine economic impact. The overall sector will continue to expand, but at a more sustainable pace. This path would closely resemble the post-dot-com consolidation, where the speculative excess of 1999 gave way to the stable, long-term growth of the digital infrastructure we rely on today.

The distinction between hype and transformation, then, lies not in the fervor of the present moment, but in what’s left once the dust settles. The ultimate test is whether AI delivers measurable, broad-based economic value and productivity improvements that justify the enormous cost of its creation. The key lesson from history is not that bubbles are avoidable, but that they are often a necessary evil for technological evolution. The challenge for investors, policymakers, and researchers is to discern where speculation ends and substance begins, and to ensure that when the air inevitably leaves this balloon, the scaffolding of progress remains standing. If there’s any point we can take from this situation, it’s that we need regulation, both economically and systemically, when it comes to managing Artificial Intelligence.
